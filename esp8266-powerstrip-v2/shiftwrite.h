byte data = 0;

void shiftWrite(int desiredPin, boolean desiredState)

// This function lets you make the shift register outputs
// HIGH or LOW in exactly the same way that you use digitalWrite().

// Like digitalWrite(), this function takes two parameters:

//    "desiredPin" is the shift register output pin
//    you want to affect (0-7)

//    "desiredState" is whether you want that output
//    to be HIGH or LOW

// Inside the Arduino, numbers are stored as arrays of "bits",
// each of which is a single 1 or 0 value. Because a "byte" type
// is also eight bits, we'll use a byte (which we named "data"
// at the top of this sketch) to send data to the shift register.
// If a bit in the byte is "1", the output will be HIGH. If the bit
// is "0", the output will be LOW.

// To turn the individual bits in "data" on and off, we'll use
// a new Arduino commands called bitWrite(), which can make
// individual bits in a number 1 or 0.
{
  // First we'll alter the global variable "data", changing the
  // desired bit to 1 or 0:

  bitWrite(data,desiredPin,desiredState);

  // Now we'll actually send that data to the shift register.
  // The shiftOut() function does all the hard work of
  // manipulating the data and clock pins to move the data
  // into the shift register:

  shiftOut(DATA_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, MSBFIRST, data);

  // Once the data is in the shift register, we still need to
  // make it appear at the outputs. We'll toggle the state of
  // the LATCH_PIN, which will signal the shift register to "latch"
  // the data to the outputs. (Latch activates on the low-to
  // -high transition).

  digitalWrite(LATCH_PIN, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(LATCH_PIN, LOW);
}
